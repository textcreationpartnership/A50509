            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>GArdening, and the pleaſant Delights of a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orchard, has been the Delight of many great Perſons, and Wiſe Men of all Ages; who have therein contemplated the Wonders of God in Nature, and refreſhed their Minds, as well as ſollaced their Bodies: There, by the help of Art, the Hand-maid to Nature, are produced ſuch Things as are highly worthy of Admiration, whilſt the travelling Sun labours to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the Earth with a kindly Heat, and enables her to produce ſuch various kinds of Fruits, Herbs, Plants, Flowers, Shrubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of different Kinds, Taſtes, Colours, Scents, Shapes, and Virtues; raviſhing to the Eye, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Taſte and Smell, and nouriſhing to the Body, all which taking with admirable Delight, ſhould incite Men not only to covet them, but to Labour in moderate Exerciſe for improving and propagating them.</p>
            <p>A Method, to do which, I have in this Book laid down, the better to invite the Ingenious and Induſtrious, to what muſt needs yield them a great meaſure of Pleaſure and Profit, having laboured in every Thing to advance this Art, as near as may be to its higheſt Perfection, omitting nothing that can be grateful to my Countrymen, as to what relates to Fruit-trees in all their Particulars; ordering Fruit when ripe, and making curious Liquor, and Wines of them.</p>
            <p>Alſo every Thing that is proper in the Kitchen-Garden, Flower-Garden, and Green-Houſe, not only as to <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but Out-landiſh Fruits, Herbs, Plants, Flowers, curious,
<pb facs="tcp:103351:3"/>
Per-annual-greens, and others; Oranges and Lemmons, Citrons, Aloes, and every Thing that is proper, for even a Royal Garden, to delight the greateſt Princes, as well as Nobles, Gentry, and private Perſons; with Monthly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon every Particular, throughout the whole, never ſo exactly done in any Work yet Extant, taken from long Experience, and upon the Judgment of thoſe that are Practicers in this Art; ſome for their Pleaſure more than Gain, and others, who employ themſelves therein for Annual Advantages. Having conſidered all Things for making a compleat Gardener, either to ſerve himfelf or others, and be grateful to Gentlemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who are curious in theſe Matters, worthy of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Care, of what Degree ſoever.</p>
            <p>A good Orchard and Garden, by all prudent Phyſicians are held much to contribute to the Health, as well as Pleaſure of thoſe that often frequent them in their refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Walks and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrages. Herein likewiſe, I have given Directions to make in the neweſt Method, Knots, Borders, Walks, Green-plats, Arbors, Hot-beds, preparing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of all Sorts, and ordering every Thing in a proper Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Reader, may the Bookſeller have ſo much Profit in Selling it, and thou the ſame Pleaſure and Profit in Buying it, that has accrued to me by Collecting, and Experience therein; I am thine to ſerve,</p>

                     <p>EXperience tell us that thoſe Flowers which differ in Number of Leafs, in colours and ſhape, their ſeeds will produce Flowers much different from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Flowers, tho' but a Year or two before produced all of one Flower; nay, a particular Flower among many others of one Plant will bring more double ones than 20 others that are not quallified in the ſame Nature.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103351:63"/>
others, it will bring forth a fine double Flower, which when it hath attained to, then it is to come to the bounds of Nature, for it never bears Seed more, but by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring blows itſelf to death.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Rule may be obſerved by the curious Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt in ſeveral other Flowers that are free from any thrum in the middle, as Auriculas, Zeal flowers, Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſes, Campions, and the like.</p>

               <p>In this Houſe you muſt have your Door and Windows to the South; and the Door that is placed in the ſide of it requires a Porch, with another Door matted, to keep the Crevices, and ſhutting cloſe, ſo that going in or our, one Door may be ſhut upon you before the other is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the cold Air may be kept out, that otherwiſe would ruſh in with much Violence.</p>
               <p>As for the Windows they muſt have Wooden-Shutters, as well as Saſhes of Glaſs well framed in, that when the Cold is extream they may be totally ſhut up; and when there is relentings or Sun-ſhiny Days, the Wooden-Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters my in the Day-time by degrees be opened to let in the Sun and Air more freely, but not the Glaſs ones be drawn up, unleſs it proves very warm and Sun-ſhiny, and then not too ſuddenly but with Caution and Diſcretion, that the Plants may take it kindly; and not find too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
