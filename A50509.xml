            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GArdening, and the plea≈øant Delights of a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orchard, has been the Delight of many great Per≈øons, and Wi≈øe Men of all Ages; who have therein contemplated the Wonders of God in Nature, and refre≈øhed their Minds, as well as ≈øollaced their Bodies: There, by the help of Art, the Hand-maid to Nature, are produced ≈øuch Things as are highly worthy of Admiration, whil≈øt the travelling Sun labours to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the Earth with a kindly Heat, and enables her to produce ≈øuch various kinds of Fruits, Herbs, Plants, Flowers, Shrubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of different Kinds, Ta≈øtes, Colours, Scents, Shapes, and Virtues; ravi≈øhing to the Eye, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to the Ta≈øte and Smell, and nouri≈øhing to the Body, all which taking with admirable Delight, ≈øhould incite Men not only to covet them, but to Labour in moderate Exerci≈øe for improving and propagating them.</p>
            <p>A Method, to do which, I have in this Book laid down, the better to invite the Ingenious and Indu≈øtrious, to what mu≈øt needs yield them a great mea≈øure of Plea≈øure and Profit, having laboured in every Thing to advance this Art, as near as may be to its highe≈øt Perfection, omitting nothing that can be grateful to my Countrymen, as to what relates to Fruit-trees in all their Particulars; ordering Fruit when ripe, and making curious Liquor, and Wines of them.</p>
            <p>Al≈øo every Thing that is proper in the Kitchen-Garden, Flower-Garden, and Green-Hou≈øe, not only as to <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but Out-landi≈øh Fruits, Herbs, Plants, Flowers, curious,

Per-annual-greens, and others; Oranges and Lemmons, Citrons, Aloes, and every Thing that is proper, for even a Royal Garden, to delight the greate≈øt Princes, as well as Nobles, Gentry, and private Per≈øons; with Monthly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations upon every Particular, throughout the whole, never ≈øo exactly done in any Work yet Extant, taken from long Experience, and upon the Judgment of tho≈øe that are Practicers in this Art; ≈øome for their Plea≈øure more than Gain, and others, who employ them≈øelves therein for Annual Advantages. Having con≈øidered all Things for making a compleat Gardener, either to ≈øerve himfelf or others, and be grateful to Gentlemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who are curious in the≈øe Matters, worthy of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons Care, of what Degree ≈øoever.</p>
            <p>A good Orchard and Garden, by all prudent Phy≈øicians are held much to contribute to the Health, as well as Plea≈øure of tho≈øe that often frequent them in their refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Walks and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>mbrages. Herein likewi≈øe, I have given Directions to make in the newe≈øt Method, Knots, Borders, Walks, Green-plats, Arbors, Hot-beds, preparing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of all Sorts, and ordering every Thing in a proper Sea≈øon.</p>
            <p>Reader, may the Book≈øeller have ≈øo much Profit in Selling it, and thou the ≈øame Plea≈øure and Profit in Buying it, that has accrued to me by Collecting, and Experience therein; I am thine to ≈øerve,</p>

others, it will bring forth a fine double Flower, which when it hath attained to, then it is to come to the bounds of Nature, for it never bears Seed more, but by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring blows it≈øelf to death.</p>

               <p>Con≈øider then that free breathing Air is that which continues the life and grotwh of Plants, as well as Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and where they are ≈øtifled and kept in too clo≈øe, tho' with Heat and ≈øubterranean Fires, as Stows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in

               <p>In this Hou≈øe you mu≈øt have your Door and Windows to the South; and the Door that is placed in the ≈øide of it requires a Porch, with another Door matted, to keep the Crevices, and ≈øhutting clo≈øe, ≈øo that going in or our, one Door may be ≈øhut upon you before the other is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the cold Air may be kept out, that otherwi≈øe would ru≈øh in with much Violence.</p>
               <p>As for the Windows they mu≈øt have Wooden-Shutters, as well as Sa≈øhes of Gla≈øs well framed in, that when the Cold is extream they may be totally ≈øhut up; and when there is relentings or Sun-≈øhiny Days, the Wooden-Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters my in the Day-time by degrees be opened to let in the Sun and Air more freely, but not the Gla≈øs ones be drawn up, unle≈øs it proves very warm and Sun-≈øhiny, and then not too ≈øuddenly but with Caution and Di≈øcretion, that the Plants may take it kindly; and not find too ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

               <p>Take off ≈øuch Leaves as wither or grow dry, and ≈øtir the Stalk or Bole of the Plant gently, that the Root may be a little loo≈øe to have the freer breathing of Air; open the Mould a little on the top, and ≈øprinkle a fre≈øh Mould on the ≈øurface, and over that a ≈ømall ≈øcattering of warm Dung; and if any Weeds or Gra≈øs grow up, take them away, ≈ømoothing over the place again, keeping ≈øuch a di≈øtance between your Rows of your Pots or Ca≈øes placed on Forms, or Stools, Tables, or the like, that you may ea≈øily pa≈øs between them to do any Office that is required for the Commodity or Advantage.</p>
